 Postmortem Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:** The outage occurred on April 14th, 2024, starting at 10:00 AM and lasting until 1:00 PM (UTC).
- **Impact:** The outage affected the user authentication service, causing users to experience login failures and access issues. Approximately 30% of users were unable to log in during the outage period.
- **Root Cause:** The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the authentication service's database connection settings.

**Timeline:**

- **10:00 AM (UTC):** Issue detected by monitoring alert indicating a spike in failed login attempts.
- **10:05 AM:** Engineering team notified of the issue through automated alerting system.
- **10:10 AM:** Initial investigation focused on network connectivity issues, but no anomalies were found.
- **10:30 AM:** Further investigation revealed database connection errors in the authentication service logs.
- **11:00 AM:** Misleading assumption made that recent database schema changes might be the cause of the issue.
- **11:30 AM:** Incident escalated to database administration team for assistance.
- **12:00 PM:** Database team identified misconfiguration in database connection pool settings as the root cause.
- **1:00 PM:** Issue resolved by correcting the database connection settings.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- **Root Cause:** The misconfiguration in the database connection pool settings caused the authentication service to exceed the maximum allowed connections, leading to login failures.
- **Resolution:** The database connection pool settings were adjusted to increase the maximum allowed connections and optimize connection handling.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement automated monitoring for database connection pool metrics to detect potential issues proactively.
  - Conduct regular audits of database configuration settings to ensure alignment with best practices.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Update documentation to include best practices for configuring database connection pools.
  - Implement automated testing for database connection settings changes to prevent misconfigurations.
  - Conduct a post-incident review to identify any additional vulnerabilities in the authentication service architecture.

This postmortem highlights the importance of proactive monitoring and regular audits in identifying and resolving infrastructure misconfigurations. By implementing corrective measures and conducting thorough reviews, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure the reliability and stability of our systems.
